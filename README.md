How to build a standalone .EXE from transcodevideo.py
-----------------------------------------------------

1) Create and Activate a Python Virtual Environment

   cd "C:\path\to\project"
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate

2) Install Dependencies

   pip install torch==2.0.1+cpu torchaudio==2.0.1+cpu -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
   pip install openai-whisper
   pip install pyinstaller

3) Confirm transcodevideo.py Works

   python .\transcodevideo.py
   # If the program runs successfully, continue.

4) Place ffmpeg.exe in the same folder as transcodevideo.py

5) Find Whisper's "assets" Folder
   It is usually in:
   C:\path\to\project\venv\Lib\site-packages\whisper\assets

6) Run PyInstaller

   pyinstaller --onefile transcodevideo.py ^
       --add-data "C:\path\to\project\venv\Lib\site-packages\whisper\assets;whisper/assets" ^
       --add-binary "ffmpeg.exe;."

   Explanation:
   - --onefile : produce a single .exe
   - --add-data : bundle Whisper's "assets" folder
   - --add-binary : bundle ffmpeg.exe
