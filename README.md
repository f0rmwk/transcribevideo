-----------------------------------------------------

   ```
   cd "C:\path\to\project"
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3) Install Dependencies

   pip install torch==2.0.1+cpu torchaudio==2.0.1+cpu -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
   pip install openai-whisper
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```
4) Confirm transcodevideo.py Works

   ```
   python .\transcodevideo.py
   ```
   
5) Place ffmpeg.exe in the same folder as transcodevideo.py

6) Find Whisper's "assets" Folder
   It is usually in:
   ```
   C:\path\to\project\venv\Lib\site-packages\whisper\assets
8) Run PyInstaller
   ```
   pyinstaller --onefile transcodevideo.py ^
       --add-data "C:\path\to\project\venv\Lib\site-packages\whisper\assets;whisper/assets" ^
       --add-binary "ffmpeg.exe;."
   ```
   Explanation:
   - --onefile : produce a single .exe
   - --add-data : bundle Whisper's "assets" folder
   - --add-binary : bundle ffmpeg.exe
